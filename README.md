# Bitmask

Minimal single-header C99 library for efficient bitmask manipulation. Provides inline functions for setting, clearing, checking individual bits, working with bit ranges, counting set bits (popcount), and iterating through set bits. Designed for embedded systems and performance-critical applications with zero memory allocations, platform independence.
